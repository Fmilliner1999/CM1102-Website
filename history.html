		C is a programming language born at AT&T's Bell Laboratory of USA in 1972. It was written by Dennis Ritchie, known as the father of C. It was created for the specific purpose of designing the UNIX operating system, and was intended to be useful and allowing busy programmers to get things done, as it was a powerful and dominant language. <br><br>
		It was called C, as many of the principles and ideas used in creatin it were derived from the earlier language B. After 7-8 years of C being in circulation, C++ was created as the first example of object oriented programming.<br><br>
		Over time, C evolved to add significant features such as memory management, functions, classes and libraries to its already rich feature set. It served as an inspiration to the development of langugages such as AMPL, AWK, csh, C++, C--. C#, Objective-C, Bit C, Go, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Python, PHP and many more. All of these listed languages are used commonly and have an important place in society today, owed to C.<br><br>
		Like most innovations, C underwent many changes over time. Probably one of its greatest achievements has been its ability to stay relevant even in modern, dynamic times. It must be fulfilling for the creators of C to observe that their creation is not considered outdated or useful for only a few niche fields. Instead, it has come to be recognised as a general-purpose, strong language which could be applied to many areas.<br><br>
